- 👋 Hi, I’m David Lee
- 👀 I’m interested in building niche products that nobody else will build; not because it's not important but because the demand is so small... -> One of One. -> This is Phase 1 of making my mark on society. 
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into Scalable infrastructures, Front-end Design, and Stateful AI Agents
- 💞️ I’m looking to apply the things I learn.
- 📫 How to reach me ....... great question....
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Coding is Creating and Creating is Fun.
- 11/04/2025 - Currently learning Flask paired with ngrok. Some of my friends use it everyday. They say it's great. I aspire to be there.
- 11/23/2025 - Built a blog powered by Ghost run on DigitalOcean Droplets and Docker. (took me 3 hours to debug and get it up and running)
